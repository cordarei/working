This is to be a literate program for using Pango to render text.

Moving parts:
- fontconfig
- freetype
- pango
- cairo
- gui library (fltk,sdl,gtk,xlib?)

since pango depends on glib anyway, just bite the bullet and use gtk? no way to
avoid awful C APIs anyway.

I looked at sfml as well but it doesn't seem straightforward to use it with pango

starts off talking about SDL, but ends up using only cairo (pangocairo can render to SDL_Surface?)

there is already a library for using pango with SDL:
http://sdlpango.sourceforge.net/
it looks limited to using pango's markup only, without lower-level apis
